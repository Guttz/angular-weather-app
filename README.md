# Loadsmart Weather Application
This is the frontend for an weather web application/coding task for Loadsmart. It's an Angular based application with Angular Material for the core components. Also it uses Googles autocomplete service to fetch addressed and search terms.

## Requirements
- Node.js version 8.x or 10.x
- Recent npm(node package manager)

## To install Angular Cli run:

```
npm install -g @angular/cli
```
More info/Ref: https://angular.io/guide/quickstart

## To setup the dependencies run:

```
npm install
```

## To run the app:

```
ng serve --open
```
Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` and try the application(Make sure you have the Backend running)

## Sample tests
- Loadsmart **(Business)**
- Taj Mahal **(Touristic Attraction)**
- Berlin **(City)** 
- Japan, Tokyo, Chiyoda City, Marunouchi, 1 Chomeâˆ’5, marunouchi house **(Specific address)** 

**IMPORTANT**: The Weather Open API used in this app has a bad support for Zip Code weather requests 
depending on the country. Countries like Brazil are not well supported. US, Germany, Japan seem more realiable.

## Bonus features
- Autocomplete to enhance user experience
- Support to generic places, cities, business
- Angular theming applied, the whole website can be controlled exporting a material theme at styles.scss
- 18 Weather icons to represent the different weathers in the table

## Next steps, improvement points:
- Caching is working directly on the component, a more elegant solution is to use [HTTP Interceptor](https://angular.io/api/common/http/HttpInterceptor) in the service.
- Extend the user feedback for all kinds of error
- Use [Data Source CDK](https://material.angular.io/components/table/overview#datasource) as a DataSource instead of JSON to allow better dynamics/perfomance while interacting with the MaterialTable
- Adding front ends testing with karma/jasmine 
- Add sticky header and paginator to Table
- Add possiblity to toggle the temperature unit clicking on it
- Provide address support when clicking on button

### Observations:
The task required to fetch the ZipCode when the user provided an specific address, and that was implemented exactly like that. However, with that the user has to always provide a street to get a ZipCode. That said, to make the experience better an second routine to find a approximate Zipcode for generic places like cities and business was implemented as well.
